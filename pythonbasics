# Step 1: Read a log file. 
          # Example log format: 
          # Username: Alice
          # Timestamp: 2025-03-02 12:00:00
          # Action: Login

# Step 2: Extract simple key-value pairs.
# Step 3: Store the parsed data in a list.
# Save the data as a CSV.

import csv

# Read the log file -  open a file called "logfile.txt" in read mode ("r") 
with open("logfile.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.readlines()  # .readlines() reads the file line by line and stores each line as an item in the list data.

# List to store parsed log entries
logs = []   #initialises an empty list where the extracted data will be stored

# Process each line
for line in data:
    parts = line.strip().split(": ")   # strip removes extra spaces or newlines. splits at colon.
    if len(parts) == 2:  # check that the line has two-part key-value structure
        key, value = parts
        logs.append({key: value})    #stores the parts in the dictionary in the format {key: value}

# Write to CSV
with open("log_output.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:    #opens output file in w-write mode
    fieldnames = ["Key", "Value"]                           #defines the column headers key, value
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames) # writes each log entry in csv format, automatically matching keys with columns
    
    writer.writeheader()                                    #writes the column names as the first row
    for entry in logs:                                      #adds each entry
        writer.writerow({"Key": list(entry.keys())[0], "Value": list(entry.values())[0]})

print("Log data saved to log_output.csv")
